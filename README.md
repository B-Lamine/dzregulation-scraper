# Introduction

The [project](https://www.medina-solutions.tech/) keeps track of regulations updates on the official websites:
- [MIPH](https://www.miph.gov.dz/)
- [ANPP](https://anpp.dz/)
- [CNPM](https://www.cnpm.org.dz/)

A scraper runs independently in the background updating files along the way. When updates occur, emails notifications are sent to subscribers. You can read more about its development in [this article](). You can also reach/follow me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lamine-bellilet/).

# Usage

In order to receive email notifications with files attached, users need to submit their name and email address on the subscribe page. Updates can be consulted and are also available for download on the same page.
